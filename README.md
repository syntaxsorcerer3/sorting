## üí° Examples

### Bubble Sort Example

```javascript
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  let n = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

// Usage
console.log(bubbleSort([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6])); // [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
